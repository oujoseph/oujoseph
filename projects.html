                        While I was interviewing for a company, the interviewer gave me an interesting engineering assignment that indirectly inspired this app. When complete, it will take a search term, several addresses, and a maximum distance. Then, it will find search terms that are within the maximum distance of each address, making travel and coordination easier for all parties involved.

                        This is an experiment in expanding my technology stack. I combined technologies that I would prefer to have more experience with-- AWS/EB, NodeJS/NPM, Google Maps API, WebSockets/REST-- technologies that I have not attempted to combine until now. The result is semi-functional, but some core functionality is still missing. Right now, it will only return up to 20 results per address, and place a marker at each location. I am still in the process of implementing a distance checker in the frontend.

                        I plan to create a login system complete with Oauth. My current client ID system is quite lacking-- it limits the backend to run on a single core and does not keep track of sessions. Each marker on the Google Maps view will have an info-box giving relevant information such as prices and ratings-- the data is actually already being pushed to the frontend. A client-side mergesort would also be useful in providing nearest-distance information in list-form as well.

                        In designing this website, I wanted to build a one-page experience for my viewers. I drew some inspiration from scrolljacking web page designs, and designed a controller in JS that relied on scrolling in order to implement a similar effect.

                        Within the one-page style, I had to make sacrifices, as cleanliness often came by sacrificing usability. Apple's advertisement page for their iPhone 5s/5c, for example, was themed to transition out a page at a time when triggered, creating a clean look, but also locking the user out of their scroll wheel. On the other hand, a continuous scroll feature, while providing the user more inherent feedback, may be less smooth and less consistent due to factors such as varying scroll speeds.

                        I decided against making fancy animations or writing more than a sentence of text per photo. Instead, I let my photos do the talking, and I think the end result is quite  enjoyable.

                        One of my main goals of building josephou.com is to improve my web design skills. With my Adventures page came one of my early attempts at building something that would interact with the user, and the knowledge gained from this experiment is what enabled me to write the current index.html.

This page is on hiatus until I figure out an implementation that is satisfactory to my standards.

                        My friend and I decided to build a food-centered social media Android app using the Google Maps Android API to share and display locations. We decided to use Firebase as a backend for its authentication and synchronization features and the simplicity of its integrated NoSQL database.

                        It was a great learning experience for me. For example, although Firebase does not support backend logic, I figured out that by cleverly structuring our DB, our DB could replace any and all backend logic our app needed.
