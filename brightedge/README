cost considerations:

I used some open alternatives to proprietary elements of this project:

Adobe illustrator costs at least $240 to use.
To extract the SVG files, I used Inkscape instead, which is free and open source.

Univers font costs at least $15-$35 to license. I instead used Google Fonts' similar Open Sans.


Implementation considerations: 

Every shade of grey for each font is slightly different, and I matched each color to correspond with the original.

The side margins are 12.5% each in the demo. However, since it is intended to be responsive, this will be different in practice.

This file expects the user to be running a browser modern enough to support SVG (Circa 2010 at the latest)

The final output is an array of objects containing a key,value pair. This makes stringifying the data into json trivial for when we want to POST the data to the backend.
